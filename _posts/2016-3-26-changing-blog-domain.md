This was a simple modification: I wanted to change my blog address from fredrick-dominy.github.io to blog.fredrickdominy.com.  

___

It required creating/modifying a CNAME property. On github, just add the domain that you are pointing to.

![CNAME Property on Github]({{ site.url }}/images/github-blog-domain-CNAME.png)

___

Then you find the CNAME editor on your webhosting control panel - mine was cPanel and I found it by searching for 'CNAME'.

Then I added the domain that I wanted to point to.

... and voilla, you are now reading this on blog.fredrickdominy.com.
