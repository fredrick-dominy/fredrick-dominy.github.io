Not as easy as you would wish (likely on purpose.) Each google photo has a unique ID but when you get the link to view the file it is a link that takes you to the google photo view. 

First, make sure the image is public and accessible (not editable.)

Then apply the ID to this url. `http://drive.google.com/uc?export=IMAGEID' where IMAGEID is the unique ID.

DONE!
