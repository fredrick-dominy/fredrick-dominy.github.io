I'm thinking about designing a checklist of items to complete prior to submitting code to a repo. 

1. Scrub console.logs or other irrelevant output.
2. For the commit - briefly summarize the ticket and then followup with a more detailed explanation of changes.

Commit message

KS-233 Added $http calls and added expressions to markup.

Modified thisFile.js with API calls for profile service.
Added expressions to another-file.html to provide user specific login controls.
Cleaned up css around login and header.


End Commit message

3.
